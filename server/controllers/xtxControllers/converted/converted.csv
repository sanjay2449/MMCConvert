The hardware store made me aware this could be a possibility due to the age of the old hardware and possibly a change from imperial to metric over the years or slight change in product over the years.I opted out of drilling new holes in the timber frame/door due to them being too close to the original hole it would just make 1 big hole and make the overall structure a lot weaker.With this information I opted to retro fit the new door hardware to the existing holes in the timber frame/door.We achieved this by drilling slightly bigger holes in the stainless hardware until it sat over the existing holes.Once this was achieved we fitted off all hardware but noted that the door was hitting the latch side, we planned door down so it could shut and sanded all edges.","0","0","0","","BAS Excluded","0","","","","","AUD","","Exclusive","AUTHORISED","551.71","Invoice"

Noted there was lots of rusty, old screws without rubber seal. This could be a factor in the issue.I also noted there is a box gutter directly above to leaking area. The silicone seals seem to be in fine but could possibly be a small pinhole.I also noted the ridge flashing further up the roof has some missing rivets and sealants that are weak and cracking. Could potentially be a factor.I inspected in the roof cavity nearby water leaked area.Did not see any visible water stains or damage but was in a tough location with only 600mm high in roof cavity.If water leak has been consistent for awhile there could be damage to timberwork framing out ceiling.I recommend taking a more in depth inspection while its raining to see if we can determine where the leak is stemmed from.I recommend if the leak is coming from the box gutter that the job gets forwarded onto a roofer/plumber.","1","0","0","","BAS Excluded","0","","","","","AUD","","Exclusive","AUTHORISED","132","Invoice"

Firstly we flood tested the tiled area/floor in outside courtyard and found that the water did indeed come through grout lines into the kitchenette room. This requires sealing up under the window/door tracks and would benefit having that entire outdoor area re-grouted to stop the water running through the grout lines and potentially under tiles and running to the lowest point (kitchenette room).I also suggest removing sealant angle on the outside and removing all sealant under bottom track and re-sealing with better/stronger water sealant.Then attaching the water sealant angle on the inside.  2. Secondly we flood tested the windows/door that divide the outside courtyard to kitchenette.We found that the water was hitting the window and running down to the bottom track then leaking into the kitchenette room.Once it landed on the bottom track there were multiple corners where the rubber seal had fallen off or was missing.This is a major reason why the water was able to impede into kitchenette room.I suggest replacing all rubber seals around windows to properly seal the bottom track or sealing over the rubber with water sealant to stop water entering bottom track.","1","130","130","200","GST on Income","13","","","","","AUD","","Exclusive","AUTHORISED","1281.5","Invoice"
